These are the instructions to compile Kiwix.

done.

* ./configure to prepare the compilation and check if all
  necessary libraries are installed. You may get more information by
  running ./configure --help

* make to compile kiwix

* make install to install it on the system

== Windows ==

* You have to install a MinGW environnement. You have to download it
her": http://download.kiwix.org/dev/MozillaBuildSetup-1.4.exe and
install it in the default proposed directory C:\mozilla-build.

* Go to C:\mozilla-build with the Windows explorer and start the
  script start-msvc9.bat. You have now an UNIX shell.

* Change the current directory by typing:
  cd /c/mozilla-build/

* Check out the kiwix client code by typing:
   svn co https://kiwix.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kiwix/moulinkiwix

  Studio express C++ compiler. You can download the installer here:
  http://download.kiwix.org/dev/vcsetup.exe

* To install it, run the self installer. Choose none of the optional
  features and install it in the default directory: 
  c:\Program Files\Microsft Visual Studio 9.0\

  register it (follow the instructions).
