<h2>Don't Panic !</h2>
<p>Using Wikimedia by moulin does not require any particular skill: only a little bit of practice.</p>
<p>You can think of the content of this distribution like a paper encyclopedia whose pages would not be sorted.</p>

<h2>How do I access the content ?</h2>
<p>While you can't browse pages one after another to reach the good one, moulin provides much more powerful tools: the search engine and the links.</p>
<p><em>The links</em> are colored (blue) and underlined text areas. Pointing the mouse hover makes the cursor transform into a &laquo;hand&raquo;. This is a sign indicating that this text is associated with some action. Left-clicking on the link makes the current page disapear to show a new one, announced by the link.</p>

<p>Wikimedia projects are heavily based on links because of their ability to link articles with others. For example, an article on the french language may propose links to the articles about alphabet, latin, or even France ; this is the richness of this tool: depending on the author's point of view, each word can link to its definition (or it's article) or a related subject.</p>

<p><em>The search engine</em> acts as a links generator. You can find it on the toolbar, located on the top of the window. You can enter one or more words in it called &laquo;keywords&raquo; ; then you valid by pressing enter and a new page appears. This new page present a list of links to articles whose names contains your keywords.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to know the name of the president of France, you can enter searchs like &laquo;president&raquo; or &laquo;france&raquo; or even &laquo;president france&raquo;. Those keywords should be choosed carefully because if none is contained in an article title, you won't get any result : you would then have to retry another search with less-specific keywords.</p>

    <a name="whatcanidowith"></a><h2>What can I do with moulin ?</h2>
    
    <p>moulin is a resource holder. It gives you access to the various content of the Wikimedia projects.</p>
    <p>Here's a list of things you can do with it:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Search who is the president, what is the population or the spoken language of any country in the world</li>
    <li>Read biographies of numerous important people</li>
    <li>Discover new species of Plants and Animals</li>
    <li>Learn the history of famous ancient civilizations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The power of this tool is <em>links</em>. Since all pages are cross-linked, you can be rambling in the Wikipedia, starting from any search, just following links as you are interested in specific subjects.</p>
    <p>If you don't know where to start, just click a link in the homepage.</p>

    <div class="figure" style="max-width: 550px; min-width: 5.5em;">

You are always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached. There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external web sites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of knowledge which you can search and traverse in a loose hierarchy for more information.</p>
